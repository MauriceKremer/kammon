# KAMmon Requirements: KISS Modem

**Status:** Requirements only. Nothing is built.
**Scope:** Seeing the state of the KISS modem, running read-only diagnostic commands, and changing the radio settings. Design: [DESIGN.md](../DESIGN.md) §4.2 (form plus snapshot). KAM side: [docs/kam-api/FeatureKamApi.md](../kam-api/FeatureKamApi.md) §7.5. Protocol and firmware behaviour: [docs/FeatureKissModem.md](../../../kam/docs/FeatureKissModem.md) and [manuals/FeatureKissModem.html](../../../kam/manuals/FeatureKissModem.html).

## 1. Summary

The **KISS modem** is the small radio board KAM talks to over a serial port. It does the LoRa radio work. KAM controls it with typed commands, mostly `SetHardware` (`0x06`) sub-commands.

The page has three parts: a **snapshot** of what the modem reports, a **query** box for read-only commands, and a **form** that changes the radio settings. A change is applied by KAM, checked by reading back the modem's stored copy, and then saved into `kam.yml` so that the next start and the reset probe use the same values (decision D5).

Three facts decide the wording on this page (from the firmware):

1. The modem answers `OK` to `SetRadio` and `SetTxPower` after only a length check. **OK means received, not applied.**
2. `GetRadio` and `GetTxPower` return a copy the host stored earlier. **A matching read-back is an echo, not proof that the radio chip accepted the values.**
3. Only RSSI, noise floor, channel-busy and the counters read real hardware.

You are responsible for choosing a frequency and power that is legal where you operate.

## 2. Goals and non-goals

**Goals**

- GL-1. Show the modem's identity, link and readings with their age.
- GL-2. Run any read-only command and show its reply.
- GL-3. Change radio settings with a preview, a clear result and a saved config.
- GL-4. Never say more than the modem proved.

**Non-goals**

- `Reboot`, the modem's crypto and identity commands, `TXtail` (unused by the firmware).
- Changing the serial port or baud rate (they need a restart).
- Full duplex. LoRa is half-duplex; KAMmon shows the value and does not let it be switched on.
- Presets by region or country.

## 3. What the page shows

| Area | Content |
|---|---|
| **Radio form** | LoRa parameters and channel-access (CSMA) parameters, each with a hint naming the KISS command and the allowed range. |
| **Notice** | "Echo, not hardware verification. SetRadio and SetTxPower answer OK when received. GetRadio and GetTxPower return stored copies. Use settings that are legal for your radio and your region." |
| **Buttons** | "Review commands" and "Restore current values". |
| **Snapshot** (right) | Device name, serial link, cached radio, RSSI, noise floor, channel busy, MCU temperature, battery, counters. |
| **Query box** | A select of read-only commands, extra fields for `GetAirtime` (packet length) and `GetSensors` (permissions), and a Run button. |
| **Command log** | Time-stamped request and reply lines, newest at the bottom. |
| **Dialog** | "Review commands": the exact steps that will be sent, with Cancel and Apply. |

### 3.1 Form fields

| Field | Unit in the form | Sent to KAM | Range | KISS command |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Frequency | MHz, 6 decimals | `frequency_hz` | 300 to 2500 MHz | `SetRadio` `0x09` |
| Bandwidth | kHz | `bandwidth_hz` | 7.8 to 500 kHz | `SetRadio` |
| Spreading factor | SF5 to SF12 | `spreading_factor` | 5 to 12 | `SetRadio` |
| Coding rate | 4/5 to 4/8 | `coding_rate` | 5 to 8 | `SetRadio` |
| TX power | dBm | `tx_power_dbm` | 1 to 22 | `SetTxPower` `0x0A` |
| Signal metadata | read-only status | always enabled; no mutation field | on | `SetSignalReport` `0x19` |
| TX delay | ms, steps of 10 | `csma.txdelay_ms` | 0 to 2550 | KISS `0x01` |
| Persistence | number | `csma.persistence` | 0 to 255 | KISS `0x02` |
| Slot time | ms, steps of 10 | `csma.slot_time_ms` | 0 to 2550 | KISS `0x03` |
| Full duplex | read-only text | `csma.full_duplex` | off | KISS `0x05` |

Persistence note: the modem transmits when a random number from 0 to 255 is at most the value, so the chance is (value + 1) / 256.

### 3.2 Read-only commands in the query box

`Ping`, `GetRadio`, `GetTxPower`, `GetCurrentRssi`, `IsChannelBusy`, `GetAirtime`, `GetNoiseFloor`, `GetVersion`, `GetStats`, `GetBattery`, `GetMCUTemp`, `GetSensors`, `GetDeviceName`, `GetSignalReport`.

## 4. Requirements

### 4.1 Snapshot and queries

| ID | Requirement | Level |
|---|---|---|
| MON-MD-1 | The snapshot is read from `GET /v1/modem` every 10 s and shows the time it was read. | MUST |
| MON-MD-2 | A value KAM reports as unsupported shows "Not supported by this board" and is not an error. A noise floor of 0 shows "Not calibrated yet". | MUST |
| MON-MD-3 | The radio line is labelled "Cached by the modem", never "Current radio setting". | MUST |
| MON-MD-4 | A query sends `POST /v1/modem/query` and appends the request and reply to the command log. | MUST |
| MON-MD-5 | `GetAirtime` takes a length of 1 to 255 bytes; `GetSensors` takes permissions 1 to 7. Other fields are checked in the browser and again by KAM. | MUST |
| MON-MD-6 | The query result shows the value, the raw reply bytes in hex, and the time taken. | SHOULD |
| MON-MD-7 | When the link is down the form and query box are disabled with "The modem is not connected." The snapshot shows its last values marked stale. | MUST |

### 4.2 Changing the radio

| ID | Requirement | Level |
|---|---|---|
| MON-MD-8 | The form starts with the current values from KAM. "Restore current values" resets it. | MUST |
| MON-MD-9 | The browser checks every range in §3.1 and shows the message beside the field. KAM checks again; a `422` message is shown against the named field. | MUST |
| MON-MD-10 | "Review commands" sends `PUT /v1/modem/radio?preview=true` and shows the steps returned by KAM in a dialog. KAMmon builds no protocol frames itself. | MUST |
| MON-MD-11 | The dialog says "Review only until you press Apply" and lists what has no reply (the CSMA frames). | MUST |
| MON-MD-12 | Apply sends `PUT /v1/modem/radio` without `preview` and permits at least 15 s for apply and bounded recovery. The dialog shows "Applying" and prevents repeated submission. After a disconnect, fetch the snapshot rather than automatically retrying. | MUST |
| MON-MD-13 | The result lists every step and distinguishes successful apply/save, failed apply with restored previous settings, and failed recovery with TX paused. Never say "Not applied" as proof no command reached the modem. Radio readback is an echo, not chip verification. | MUST |
| MON-MD-14 | A `409` (another change running) or `503` (link down) shows its message and leaves the form as entered. | MUST |
| MON-MD-15 | After a successful change the snapshot is refreshed at once, and the node block and Overview show the new radio line. | MUST |
| MON-MD-16 | If KAM reports a rollback, the page says which values the modem has again. | MUST |
| MON-MD-17 | The page notes that saving rewrites `kam.yml` and removes any comments in it. | MUST |
| MON-MD-18 | The legal-use sentence from §1 is shown next to the Apply control. | MUST |
| MON-MD-19 | If `full_duplex` is on in KAM, the page shows a warning that this is harmful on a half-duplex LoRa radio, and does not let it be changed. | SHOULD |

### 4.3 Command log

| ID | Requirement | Level |
|---|---|---|
| MON-MD-20 | The log keeps the last 200 lines in KAMmon memory, shared by admin sessions, lost at restart. | MUST |
| MON-MD-21 | Each line shows the time, the command name and code, and the reply or "no reply". Lines never claim a setting was verified. | MUST |
| MON-MD-22 | The log is an `aria-live` region that scrolls inside its box. | MUST |
| MON-MD-23 | Signal reporting is status-only and always enabled; expose no checkbox or saved setting. | MUST |

## 5. What KAMmon needs from KAM

| Need | Endpoint | KAM requirement |
|---|---|---|
| Snapshot | `GET /v1/modem` | API-MD-1, API-MD-10 |
| One read-only command | `POST /v1/modem/query` | API-MD-2 |
| Preview and apply | `PUT /v1/modem/radio` (`?preview=true`) | API-MD-3, API-MD-4 |
| One change at a time, safe timing | Behaviour | API-MD-5 |
| Saved only after a matching echo; rollback | Behaviour | API-MD-6 |
| New values reach the probe, airtime estimate and scheduler | Behaviour | API-MD-7 |
| Wording of results | `modem_echo` | API-MD-8 |
| Link and reset events | `modem` events | API-EV-7 |

KAM keeps the radio client away from Starlark (`API-MD-9`) and rejects bad input itself (`API-F-12`).

## 6. Visibility

| Element | Viewer | Admin |
|---|---|---|
| Snapshot and radio values | Yes | Yes |
| Radio form, query box, command log | No | Yes |

## 7. Tests

- Field range checks at the edges: 299 and 300 MHz, 7.7 and 7.8 kHz, SF4 and SF5, CR4 and CR5, 0 and 1 dBm, 22 and 23 dBm, 2550 and 2560 ms, persistence 255 and 256.
- A fake KAM: preview, apply ok, `422`, `409`, `502` with partial steps, `503`, rollback reported.
- Wording tests: no page text contains "verified" next to an echo.
- Viewer routes return `403`.
- The form is disabled when the link is down.

## 8. Corrections to the prototype

The prototype applies changes in the browser only and prints simulated replies. It builds the command list itself; KAMmon must take it from KAM. The prototype's sample battery line says "Unsupported"; the real snapshot uses `null` plus the `unsupported` list.

## 9. Open points

- Whether a "Restore previous values" button should offer the values before the last successful change (KAMmon would keep them in memory only).
- Whether the radio form should warn when the frequency is outside common licence-free bands. KAM cannot know the region.
